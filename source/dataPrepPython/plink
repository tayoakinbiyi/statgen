plink --file ail --map3
The PED file is a white-space (space or tab) delimited file: the first six columns are mandatory:
     Family ID
     Individual ID
     Paternal ID
     Maternal ID
     Sex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown)
     Phenotype
     
2 individuals typed for 3 snps
     FAM001  1  0 0  1  2  A A  G G  A C 
     FAM001  2  0 0  1  2  A A  A G  0 0 

By default, each line of the MAP file describes a single marker and must contain exactly 4 columns:
     chromosome (1-22, X, Y or 0 if unplaced)
     rs# or snp identifier
     Genetic distance (morgans)
     Base-pair position (bp units)
     
can use --map3
In this case, the three columns are expected to be
     chromosome (1-22, X, Y or 0 if unplaced)
     rs# or snp identifier
     Base-pair position (bp units)
